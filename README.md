# git-training
Just a training project to mastering Git

## Step One

1. Creating repo on Github
2. Do "$ git clone" on local
3. Create a new branch "$ git branch b1" 
4. Add a index.html page
5. Staging the new file "$ git add ." / git add index.html / git add -i
6. Commit changes "$ git commit -m "initial commit with index.html"

==> Push it to Github

7. Merge with master
8. Delete branch

## Step Two

Now we need to do some new work.

1. New branch b2
2. Add a about.html file
3. Add a link to about.html in index.html
4. Oh! We forgot to add a "Hello world" title on index.html
5. Go back on master branch (what's going on ?)
6. New branch b3
